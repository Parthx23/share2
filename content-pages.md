# FastShare Content Pages

## 1. About Page (/about)

FastShare is a free web service that lets you share text and small files through temporary links. All shared content automatically expires and is permanently deleted after one hour, ensuring your information doesn't stay online forever.

We built FastShare with privacy in mind. No account registration is required, and we don't collect personal information. This makes it perfect for college students, developers, and professionals who need to quickly share code snippets, notes, or small files without worrying about data persistence or privacy concerns.

Our ephemeral storage approach means your content is automatically deleted from our servers after the one-hour expiration period. This temporary storage model protects your privacy while providing a convenient sharing solution for short-term collaboration and communication needs.

### Cookies

FastShare uses only essential cookies required for basic functionality. Our advertising partner (Google AdSense) may use cookies for ad personalization. No tracking cookies are used by FastShare directly.
